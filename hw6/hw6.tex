\begin{exercise}[3.2.2]
  \begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
    \item Limit points of $A$: $\{-1, 1\}$. Limit points of $B$: $[0, 1]$.
    \item $A$ is neither open nor closed. $B$ is neither open nor closed.
    \item $A$ contains isolated points. $B$ does not contain isolated points.
    \item $\overline{A} = A \cup \{-1\}$. $\overline{B} = [0, 1]$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[3.2.4]
  \begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
    \item If $s \in A$, then $s \in \overline{A}$ and we are done. Now suppose
      $s \notin A$. By Lemma 1.3.8, for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $a
      \in A$ ($a \neq s$) such that $s - \epsilon < a$. Since $s = \sup(A)$, we
      also know that $a < s$. Thus, every $\epsilon$-neighborhood
      $V_\epsilon(s)$ intersects $A$ at some point other than $s$. That is, $s$
      is a limit point of $A$, so $s \in \overline{A}$ in this case as well.
    \item An open set $O$ cannot contain its supremum $s = \sup(O)$ since every
      $\epsilon$-neighborhood $V_\epsilon(s)$ of $s$ is not be a subset of $O$.
      Specifically, this is because for any $\epsilon > 0$ and $a \in O$, we
      have that $a < s + \epsilon$ since $s = \sup(O)$.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}[3.2.6]
  \begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
    \item False. Consider the open set $\R \setminus \{\sqrt{2}\}$.
    \item False. Consider the closed sets of the form $C_n = \lbrack n, \infty
      \rparen$ for $n \in \N$. Observe that $C_n \subseteq C_{n+1}$ and
      $\cup_{n=1}^\infty C_n = \emptyset$.
    \item True. Given a nonempty open set $O$, we know that for $a \in O$, there
      exists an $\epsilon$-neighborhood $V_\epsilon(a) \subseteq O$. By the
      Density of $\Q$ in $\R$, there exists a rational number $r \in
      V_\epsilon(a)$. Thus, we have that $r \in O$.
    \item False. Consider the bounded infinite closed set $F = \{\sqrt{2} + 1/n
      \st n \in \N\} \cup \{\sqrt{2}\}$. Observe that $F$ does not contain any
      rational number.
    \item True. The Canter set is defined as $C = \cap_{n=0}^\infty C_n$. Since
      each $C_n$ is the union of a finite collection of closed sets, each $C_n$
      is closed. The intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets is
      closed, so the Cantor set $C$ is closed.

\begin{exercise}[3.2.8]
  \begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
    \item Definitely closed.
    \item Definitely open. % $A \setminus B = A \cap B^c$
    \item Definitely open.
    \item Both. % $(A \cap B) \cup (A^c \cap B) = \R$
    \item Neither.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[3.2.9]
  \begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
    \item TODO
    \item Suppose $\{E_\lambda \st \lambda \in \Lambda\}$ is a finite collection
      of open sets. Each $E_\lambda^c$ is thus a closed set by Theorem 3.2.13.
      As such, $\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda^c$ is the union of a finite
      collection of closed sets. By Theorem 3.2.3, $\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda}
      E_\lambda$ is open. It follows that ${(\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda}
      E_\lambda)}^c$ is closed by Theorem 3.2.13. Since ${(\cap_{\lambda \in
      \Lambda} E_\lambda)}^c= \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda^c$, the union
      of a finite collection of closed sets is therefore closed.

      Suppose $\{E_\lambda \st \lambda \in \Lambda\}$ is an arbitrary
      collection of open sets. As such, $\cap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda^c$
      is the intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed sets. By Theorem
      3.2.3, $\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda$ is open. It follows that
      ${(\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda)}^c$ is closed by Theorem 3.2.13.
      Since ${(\cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_\lambda)}^c = \cap_{\lambda \in
      \Lambda} E_\lambda^c$, the intersection of an arbitrary collection of
      closed sets is closed.
